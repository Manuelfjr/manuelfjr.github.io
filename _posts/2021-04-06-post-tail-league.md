We are the Technology and Artificial Intelligence League (TAIL), a non-profit organization directed by students. Our journey started in 2020, during the pandemics. We are located at João Pessoa-Paraíba, Brazil, linked to the Artificial Intelligence Applications laboratory, ARIA - UFPB.

TAIL emerged intending to develop its members, promoting content from different areas and with an interest in developing research in ​​Artificial Intelligence. Our body of members is composed of PhD professors, master and undergraduate students.
